Disturbance:Navigating Urban Chaos 
The concept of traffic is frequently associated with metropolises, especially those grappling with urban planning challenges that extend beyond the confines of their roads. This project is intricately linked to Bangkok's traffic issues and the pollution it generates, encompassing noise, air pollution, and other factors. The objective is to critically analyze and delve into the atmospheric quality experienced in traffic. This involves utilizing embedded primary sources of data collection to challenge the typology of traffic and the underlying elements that define it. The project seeks to provide a comprehensive description of what it means to navigate the urban landscape, particularly in the context of Bangkok.
